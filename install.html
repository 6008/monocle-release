            <h1><p class="text-center">Installing Monocle</p></h1>


          <br>

<h3> Required software </h3>

<p>Monocle runs in the <a href= "http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical
computing environment</a>. You will need R version 3.4 or higher, Bioconductor
version 3.5, and monocle 2.4.0 or higher to have access to the latest features.
To install <a href= "http://bioconductor.org/install/">Bioconductor</a>:

{% highlight R %}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Once you've installed Bioconductor, you're ready to install Monocle and all
of its required dependencies:

{% highlight R %}
> biocLite("monocle")
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
<br>

<h3> Testing the installation </h3>

<p>To ensure that Monocle was installed correctly, start a new R session and type:

{% highlight R %}
library(monocle)
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
<br>

<h3> Installing the latest Beta release</h3>
<p>The latest stable release of Monocle is available through Bioconductor, and we
recommend you use that. However, you can also install our latest public beta
build through GitHub as show below. Enter the following commands at the R
console:

{% highlight R %}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cole-trapnell-lab/monocle-release@develop")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Sometimes we add features that require you install certain additional packages.
You may see errors when you try the above command. You can install the packages
in the error message by typing (for example):

{% highlight R %}
biocLite(c("DDRTree", "pheatmap"))
{% endhighlight %}
