MONOCLE 0.99.0-alpha1
=======================

This is an ALPHA release of the Monocle analysis toolkit for
single-cell RNA-Seq experiments.  To use this package, you 
will need the R statistical computing environment (version 3.0 or later)
and several packages available through Bioconductor and CRAN.

This package is in the ALPHA stage of development, meaning
features and interfaces are subject to change as newer
versions are released.  Updates to Monocle will be distributed
through the Monocle website at:

http://monocle-bio.sourceforge.net

This release supports Mac OS X and Linux. Windows may support this 
build, but Monocle has not been tested on Windows yet.

To install this package, type the command below at the terminal:

R CMD INSTALL monocle_0.99.0.tar.gz
